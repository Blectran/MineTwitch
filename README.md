# Challonge

Challonge is a Minecraft Twitch Intergration.

Viewers can vote on commands they want to happen in the game.

The command with the most votes is what will be executed and ran on all players ( Multiplayer Compatiable ).

So twitch chat is allowed to vote on different commands and whatever they should be nice or stupid with the streamer.

while the streamer is trying to beat the game like normal.
